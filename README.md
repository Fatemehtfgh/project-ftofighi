# Habit & Task Tracker

This project is a simple weekly habit and task tracker. It helps you stay on top of the small things you want to do regularly, like habits you want to build or tasks you need to finish.

## What You Can Do

- Add habits (like "Drink water" or "Go for a walk")
- Add tasks ("Phone bill" or "Lundary")
- Mark them as completed each day
- Remove things you don’t want to track anymore
- View your progress with daily and weekly reports

## How to Use It

1. Open the notebook `Project-ftofighi.ipynb`.
2. Run the code cells from top to bottom.
3. When the menu appears, pick a number to choose what you want to do.
4. It will ask you for things like a day or task name.
5. At any time, you can check your progress for the day or the week.

## HPC Version

There’s a version of the project designed to run on a high-performance computing cluster. That script looks through several datasets and gives a weekly report for each one. The file is called `Project-HPC-ftofighi.py`, and it can be run using a job script on the ACENET cluster.
